#  U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators Analysis
 ## Overview
 This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators
 dataset from the CDC. The analysis investigates trends, geographic variations, and topic-based
 differences in chronic disease prevalence.
 
 ## Dataset Source
 Dataset: U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators
 Source URL:
 CDC Data Portal
 Description: The dataset contains key chronic disease metrics, risk factors, and
 stratifications across U.S. locations.
 
 ## Methodology
 The analysis followed these main steps:
 1. Data Loading & Cleaning:
 Imported the CSV file using Pandas.
 Standardized column names, handled missing values, and transformed data where
 needed.
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 Generated summary statistics.
 Visualized the data distribution using histograms, bar charts, and line charts (using
 Matplotlib).
 3. Analysis of Business Questions:
 Compared state-level differences in chronic disease prevalence.
 Analyzed time trends by converting year columns to datetime.
 Explored topic-based variations in the chronic disease indicators.

 ## Key Insights
 California reported the highest number of chronic disease cases among U.S. states.
 National data shows a downward trend in chronic disease indicators.
 Chronic kidney disease has the most health indicators tracked compared to other chronic diseases.
